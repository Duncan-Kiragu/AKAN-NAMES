## DESCRIPTION
Akan-Names is a web application that enables a person to tell the day of the week in which they were born and their corresponding
Ghananian Akan names which are heavily dependent on gender and the day of birth. 

## SETUP
Open the live link to the website *https://duncan-kiragu.github.io/AKAN-NAMES/* 
It requires Internet connection to be able to connect.
If you are using a Linux or Mac based operating system :*open your terminal and type git clone https://github.com/Duncan-Kiragu/AKAN-NAMES.git*
extract the file
cd to the Akan-Names directory
Open the index.html on your favorite browser but *preferably Chrome or Chromium browser*

## BEHAVIOUR DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT(B.D.D)
The website has a form at the bottom where the data for computation which in this case is gender and birth day details is input.The data is processed where it runs through logical and mathematical comparisons and gives results in form of an alert stating:
*"your Akan name is"* 
showing the the input name and later gives an alert 
*"and you were born on "*
a specific day of the week

# KNOWN BUGS
The web app does not account for transgender people. The web app also displays output through alerts instead of an embedded message
