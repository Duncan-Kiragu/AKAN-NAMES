## DESCRIPTION
Akan-Names is a web application that enables a person to tell the day of the week in which they were born and their corresponding
Ghananian Akan names which are heavily dependent on gender and the day of birth. 

## SETUP
Open the live link to the website located at the description section or at the bottom of this documentation 
It requires Internet connection to be able to connect.

## BEHAVIOUR DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT(B.D.D)
The website prompts the user to enter the Date of birth using numerical data in the text boxes outlined.Ensuring the checkboxes have been checked.the program adds the data collected on the format yyyy/mm/dd and then finds the day of the week using 0-6 numerals to show the day e.g 0=Sunday.It later gives an alert "your Akan name is" showing the child's name and later gives an alert "You were born on " showing the day of the week...
